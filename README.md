# CSCI6511Project
Project 1: 

(1) solve maze; 

(2) Tic Tac Toe game

Project 2: generalized Tic Tac Toe game 

Board size: m

Winning condition: n chess in a row

Algorithm: using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta prunning

Improvements: I pass the board score down with the recursion and update the board score according to the partial difference, 
this avoid unnecessary evaluation and save computation time.
